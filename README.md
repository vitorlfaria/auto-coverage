# auto-coverage README

A simple extension for automatically generating test coverage reports with one click. Initially it only works with dotnet, it uses [ReportGenerator](https://reportgenerator.io/) to generate the report.

## Quick Start

In this initial version the only feature is to add a button to the status bar that can be clicked to generate the report.

- Install the extension.
- Open the root .net project folder in vscode
- Click on the `Generate Report` button on the bottom status bar of vscode

**Enjoy!**
